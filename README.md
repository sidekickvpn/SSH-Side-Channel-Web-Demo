# SSH-Side-Channel-Web-Demo
Uses v86 and a minimal Linux image built with Yocto to provide an interactive demo of side-channel information leaks in SSH remote shells.

See a live demo at [https://sidekickvpn.github.io/SSH-Side-Channel-Web-Demo](https://sidekickvpn.github.io/SSH-Side-Channel-Web-Demo).
